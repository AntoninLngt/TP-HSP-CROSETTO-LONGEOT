# TP-HSP-CROSETTO-LONGEOT
CNN Implemetation Hardware for signal processing

**The ultimate goal of these 4 sessions is to implement the inference of a very clear CNN: LeNet-5 proposed by Yann LeCun et al.
by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998 for handwritten digit recognition**

## 29/11 : First Practical
In this session we work on a knowing CUDAwith Matrix multiplication :
- Design multiplication function in Cuda
- Understanding the difference between the CPU (sequential) & the GPU (parallelization)
- Compare the time for running a programm under GPU & CPU
